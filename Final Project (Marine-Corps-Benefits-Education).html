                <p><B>A CULTURE OF CONTINUAL LEARNING</b></p>
    
                <pre>
                    The Marine Corps thinks that a greater education results in a Marine who is even more capable. 

                    We convert our ideas into tools, allowing us to operate above everyone, and make solutions for every challenge. 
                    
                    Marines have access to educational possibilities that will better the combat force that they were yesterday.
                </pre>                                 
            
                <br>
    
                <p><B>BENEFITS IN SUPPORT OF OUR NATION</b></p>
    
                <pre>
                    Marines are dedicated to getting the knowledge they need to further themselves and our country.

                    As we triumph in conflicts both within and beyond the classroom, we hold ourselves to the greatest standards.

                    By funding up to 100% of your tuition costs through federal government programs like Tuition Assistance, 
                    the Montgomery GI Bill, and the Marine Corps College Fund, if you join us, we will invest in your education.

                <p><b>A CULTURE OF CONTINUAL LEARNING</b></p>
            
                <pre>
                    Winning complex battles on the modern battlefield requires a highly educated force, 
                    and it is for this reason that the Corps invests in the education of those who commit to fighting for our Nation. 
                    
                    The Marine Corps will give you every opportunity to sharpen your mind while you advance your education. 
                    
                    As a Marine, you will be encouraged to pursue your college degree while on active duty,
                    or even after you complete your service and return to civilian life, so that you're just as adept at leading in communities as you are on battlefields. 
                     
                    In fact, many Marines start obtaining college credits immediately, even while in recruit training. 
                     
                    Continuing your education is a vital part of being fighting fit, and the Marine Corps will make every opportunity available
                    to help you achieve your educational goals as a United States Marine.

                <p><b>PRIDE EARNED IN A COLLECTIVE FIGHT</b></p>
    
                <pre>
                    A Marine's pride is not an egotistical pride, but rather a sense of dignity and respect in having achieved the mental, physical,
                    and emotional trials necessary to become an exceptional combatant for our country.
                    
                    
                    Marines are proud people who share a similar goal and belong to the Corps, the Corps and each other as well as the country we serve.
                    
                    To win every war now and in the future, we are devoted to one another.
                    
                    Those dedicated to a force unlike any other in the world are among our ranks.

                <pre>
                    As Marines, we take the necessary steps to ensure we know more today than we did yesterday, so that our Nation can also continuously advance.
                    
                    The Marine Corps ensures all Marines have the means to achieve a higher education through the following programs:

                        Any duty station can participate in the Tuition Assistance Program, and doing so could potentially increase your chances of getting promoted. 
                        Marines must maintain a "C" grade point average while enrolled in order to continue earning these perks.

                    <b>ADVANCED DEGREE PROGRAM (ADP)</b>

                    Marines can obtain tax-free aid toward a college education because to the Montgomery GI Bill.

                    It permits Marines to pursue advanced degrees at authorized universities in certain Military Occupational

                    service by enrolling full-time at a recognized four-year university. 
                    
                    While still earning full pay and allowances from the Marine Corps, these perks must be earned.

                    Marines who have attained the rank of staff sergeant or above and who have acquired enough college credits
