                    Each level has a paygrade that corresponds to it, ranging from private (E-1) through E-9.


                        To become a noncommissioned officer, or NCO, is the next big step after lance corporal.

                        Corporal comes first in the NCO ranks, followed by sergeant and finally staff NCOs, which are the highest levels in the Corps.
                        
                        Staff sergeant, gunnery sergeant, master sergeant, and first sergeant are the staff NCO levels, respectively.
