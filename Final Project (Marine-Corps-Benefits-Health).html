                <pre>
                    Marine Corps healthcare and medical insurance maintain its Marines healthy,
                    enabling them to support their families who are supporting them at home as well as to win every fight they engage in.

                    Every Marine and his or her immediate family will be entitled to a number of health benefits while serving in the Marine Corps,
                    including free comprehensive medical insurance and reasonably cost dental insurance, access to top-notch medical facilities on base, and more.

                    Additionally, medical benefits continue for Marines after retirement as long as they remain in the Marine Corps.

                <p><B>AT ALL TIMES, FIT TO FIGHT</b></p>
    
                <pre>
                    The Marine Corps cannot take time off when it comes to making sure we are the force the Nation can always rely on to win its fights now and in the future.
                    Because of this, we go above and above to keep the Marines healthy so that they are always in top physical condition and prepared to serve their country.
                
                    The advantages of becoming a Marine far exceed a simple list of benefits: Marines are supported by the Marine Corps warriorhood,
                    as well as by a range of personal and professional resources. During active service, and even long after service, Marines and their families
                    have access to world-class support, including these benefits that ensure their health:

                    <li>TRICARE coverage for Marines on active duty or in the Reserve, Retired Marines and Marine family members</li>
                    <li>Additional life insurance coverage at minimal cost</li>
                    <li>Lifetime medical benefits at reduced rates for retired members.</li></center>
                </pre>

                <p><b>WORLD-CLASS MEDICAL FACILITIES</b></p>
            
                <pre>
                    Marine Corps health insurance keeps Marines healthy so we can overcome obstacles both now and in the future, and comprehensive health insurance
                    is offered to help our Marine families who are so important to our country's battle.
                     
                    All active-duty Marines, their dependents, and retired Marines have access to first-rate medical facilities that are on base or conveniently
                    situated nearby where our Marines are stationed. Marines and their families are sent to a civilian hospital at low or no cost if there are no medical
                    services on site.
