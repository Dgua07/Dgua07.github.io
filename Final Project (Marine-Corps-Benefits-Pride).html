                <p><B>"US MARINE" IS MORE THAN JUST A TITLE. ALL MARINES ARE UNITED TO THE GOAL WE FIGHT FOR BY A SHARED IDENTITY.</b></p>

                <pre>
                    The preservation of our country and the development of its principles are the some of the few things that unite the family that is the USMC.
             
                    We are brothers and sisters working together as one unstoppable movement. 
            
                    We enjoy challenges and look forward to difficulties. 
             
                    Together, every Marine forms a powerful force that is older than the country we are defending and larger than any one person.

                <br>

                <p><B>PURPOSE FOUND. BELONGING SHARED.</b></p>

                <pre>
                    You are able to accomplish more when you join something bigger. You develop a unique kinship when you battle for a common cause. 

                    A shared combative spirit a collective insistence on winning. Being this means being a part of it. 

                    A greater purpose is discovered during the 13-week arduous and challenging journey of the Marine Corps recruitment process.
                    
                    Do you have what it takes to prevail in the conflicts you face alongside people who won't leave your side? Can you give it your all? 
                
                    Can you muster the fortitude to contend and the resolve to prevail? Marines are ready to win fights wherever they occur. 
                </pre>

                <h3 align="center">Are you prepared for battle with your resolve?</h3>

                <br>

                <p><b>A FIGHTING FORCE MADE FROM THE MORAL FIBER OF OUR NATION</b></p>
        
                <pre>
                    There are similarities among individuals weaved from the principles they are prepared to uphold, as well as what they can withstand.

                    Because of things such as their good intent and the promises they make, it revitalizes America's spirit with a spirit of their own resistance.

                    And it is all while they figure out a means to prevail in each and every conflict, all fueled by a sense of connection to an unbreakable tie.
                </pre>

                <br>

                <p><b>A MINDSET THAT REFUSES TO LOSE</b></p>

                <pre>
                    The world's injustices don't fix themselves.

                    The ability to withstand more than most, as well as a resolve that will not waver, are necessary for us to prevail in the wars we fight.   
                    
                    On any battlefield, facing any task, obstruction, or enemy, if you have the mentality of a Marine, you may be an asset for our country.
